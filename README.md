# Pyber_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is trying to compare the fares charged in diffferent city types and find out the trend and relationships between the fares and the months.

Results:

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)


In the dataframe challenge_df3 shown below, we can see "average fare per ride" and "average fare per driver" are the highest in rural city type, but amount of rides and drivers are less in rural city. If we calculate and look at the total fare collected from January through April, rural city type produced the least amount of aggregate fare collected. By contrast, urban city type produced the highest aggregate fare. Additionally, the 3 different city types produce roughly the same rate over time of fare collected. This is indicated by the relatively flatness of the lines shown in totalfarebycity graph.
